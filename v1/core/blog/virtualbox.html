<p class="par">Ubuntu is a great OS and lots of fun but before you go wiping your hard drive and installing Ubuntu maybe you should try it out on your current system first.</p>
<p class="par"><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" class="blog-link">Virtual Box</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine" class="blog-link">virtual machine</a> program for Windows, Linux and OSX. It's great for running other operating systems in your current computer and is what were going to be using today.</p>
<p class="par">To install <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" class="blog-link">Ubuntu</a> for your system simply go to Ubuntu's website and download the latest 32 bit ISO for desktop. Then go to the Virtual Box website and download the <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" class="blog-link">client</a> for windows. Next install Virtual Box using the recommended settings and click "New", point it to the ISO you just downloaded. Lastly run through the install setup for Ubuntu and enjoy.</p>
