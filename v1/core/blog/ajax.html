<p class="par"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)" class="blog-link">Ajax</a> (short for asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a way to make <a href="http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2008/11/howajaxworks.gif" class="blog-link">asynchronous client-side web apps</a>. This means it allows you to dynamically make requests to a server and change html on page. Simplified that means you can refresh certain parts of the page without having to have the user keep pressing refresh.</p>
<p class="par">An example of this would be an online chat program. The html item that displays your chat will be updated with an Ajax call instead of the user having to refresh the page when they want to see if they have a new message. So next time you need to make asynchronous/dynamic web app look at Ajax.
