<p class="par">I recently got the <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp" class="blog-link">stock</a> trading fever. Now I could hire a broker and have them manage my stocks or I could use the magic of python to help me out.</p>
<p class="par">So I made this <a href="https://github.com/JacobTheEvans/Trading-Bot" class="blog-link">program</a> to assist in managing stocks. The basic idea of this project is that instead of checking the stock market yourself you let python do it and report back. So I used the urllib2 library to check <a href="https://www.google.com/finance" class="blog-link">google finance</a> for all current holdings in the database(provided by the user). When gross profit for a certian stock would be more then 3.5% if sold It informs the user.</p>
