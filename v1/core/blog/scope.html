<p class="par">When working with JavaScript a fundamental concept you need to understand is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_scope.asp" class="blog-link">variable scope</a>.</p>
<p class="par">In most other programming languages a variable scope is controlled by where it falls in brackets({ }) but not in JavaScript. JavaScript variable scope is controlled by function scope. Meaning that if a variable is declared outside of a function it is a global variable. Also that if a variable is declared in a function it is local to that function and cannot be accessed outside of its scope.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
//Can be accessed by any other code
var someVar = "Is global";

function someFunc() {
  //Can only be accessed code inside of someFunc
  var someOtherVar = "Is local";
}
</pre>
<p class="par">But be warned when you are inside of a function you must use the “var” keyword or else the variable is now global.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
function someFunc() {
  someVar = "A var";
}
someFunc();
console.log(someVar);
//prints "A var"
</pre>
